<h4>
<a href="http://square.github.io/crossfilter/">Crossfilter</a> is a JavaScript library that enables in-browser exploration of large multivariate datasets.
</h4>
<h4>
It was developed by <a href="https://squareup.com/register">Square Register</a> to facilitate browser-based analytics of their clients' transaction history.
</h4>
<h4>
As a JavaScript library, it requires no additional plug-ins, and provides browser-based functionalities similar to that of an OLAP server.
</h4>
<h4>
It is able to slice and dice data on multiple dimensions with extremely efficient levels of speed, and can be readily tied into a number of different charting and graphing libraries.
</h4>
<p>
We will first present an example of its use against a large dataset representing half-hourly 4G network performance data from 1600 cell towers between July and December 2014 
and illustrate its advantages over the crossfilter function in Tableau Server, currently used by Verizon Wireless.
</p><p>
We will then present a <a href="../../15/crossfilter-demo/">visual exploration</a> of BLS data using the JavaScript charting library Dimensional Charting in concert with Crossfilter.
