<h4>
<a href="http://square.github.io/crossfilter/">Crossfilter</a> is a JavaScript library that enables in-browser exploration of large multivariate datasets.
</h4>
<h4>
It was developed by <a href="https://squareup.com/register">Square Register</a> to facilitate browser-based analytics of their clients' transaction history.
</h4>
<h4>
As a JavaScript library, it requires no additional plug-ins, and provides browser-based functionalities similar to that of an OLAP server.
</h4>
<h4>
It is able to slice and dice data on multiple dimensions with extremely efficient levels of speed, and can be readily tied into a number of different charting and graphing libraries.
</h4>
<p>
We will first present an example of its use against a large dataset representing half-hourly 4G network performance data from 1600 cell towers between July and December 2014 
and illustrate its advantages over the crossfilter function in Tableau Server,currently used by Verizon Wireless.

We will then present a <a href="../../../15/crossfilter-demo/">visual exploration</a> of BLS data using the JavaScript charting library Dimensional Charting in concert with Crossfilter.
