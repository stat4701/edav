#NYC Accident Data Preliminary Analysis

###Concept:

  Starting with a cleaned version of NYPD's Crash Data which can be obtained at [NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid](http://nypd.openscrape.com/#/).  I wanted to determine the most accident prone locations within the 300,000 sample data set and plot onto a map of each of the 5 boroughs.  I also started looking at most dangerous pedestrian intersections around New York and Columbia University specifically.  Also, I started playing with overlaying a bin map with a few types of bins (cyclists and pedestrians killed, and a variety of primary causes of accidents).  Lastly, I wanted to plot a density of accidents map which I believe would be proportional to the traffic density, however I was unable to correlate that as average traffic density in New York is difficult to find.
  
###Libraries Used:

[ggmap](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html) - allows for the easy visualization of spatial data and models on top of Google Maps, OpenStreetMaps, Stamen Maps, or CloudMade Maps using ggplot2.

[SQLDF](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html) - Manipulate R data frames using SQL. Being more comfortable with SQL queries I wanted a package to manipulate the data.

###Difficulties and Issues:
  * Strange issue with variables and functions.  Likely relating to environment (namespace) 
  * Binning proved difficult to plot and took longer to munge into the proper format for bin and density graphs
  * Would like to clean up functions to better handle sorting, filtering, grouping to make further analysis cleaner and easier.
