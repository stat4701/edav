Most of us get weather information from one source or another every day. It is broadcast over Radio and TV. It is part of the news. It is pulled in and displayed on the our PCs and laptops in toolbars and widgets. It comes via apps bundled with smartphones. From dedicated websites. From dedicated TV channels. Even from car navigation systems. In short, we swim in weather data. 

This “weather” that we consume in many different forms is all about data. In this post I want to focus on how this data is presented in a narrow slice of the electronic world -- major weather websites and mobile apps. 

My original idea for this blog post was to focus only on mobile apps. But, after talking to some fellow students I realized that there maybe a wide variety of ways people look at weather. So put together a short online survey and sent it to the class. The responses showed that many people still consume weather data from the major websites. As a result, I am breaking this post up in two parts. Part 1 (this post) will focus on popular sites and Part 2 will focus on mobile apps. 

Most of the weather-related websites actually want you to scroll or press buttons to get what you want. I guess advertisement dollars are at play here. I tried to capture the full pages using a Chrome extension that takes screenshots by scrolling the page.  

### Weather.com

Alexa ranks it at 31st most popular site in the US (right behind NYT). It is also the most popular weather-related site.

The website does not look to be an epitome of good site design. From visualization perspective, it is a disaster.

Here's the landing page. The landing page is a big collection of things that you may or may not choose to click or tap. But what you most commonly need, i.e. the weather info, is about 10% or less of the first screen. Maybe the landing page serves a purpose that's beyond me. 

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/landing.png">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/landing.png" width="50%">
</a>

If you are on this site for weather info you would probably click on "Full Forecast" or you will have the local weathe page book marked. Either way, you will end up with an equally long page that screams "busy". Notice how this page has a bunch of useful weather info mixed in with ads, "sponsored content" and pure click-bait. There are two almost hidden links for "Current Details" and "Next Few Hours". I also noticed the enormous empty space in the middle of the screen. Rigth where your eyes would focus.  
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/today.png">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/today.png" width="50%">
</a>


If you expand the forecast for today you continue to get these high-noise-to-signal-ratio pages. I'll just focus on the top of the page where the useful information is. 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/expanded.png">

</a>

The 10 day forecast page isn't all that bad. The highs and lows are there together with icons and descriptitve text. A quick graph would be a great addition (more on that later). Removing the background clutter would be even beter. The background image is just not that exciting or useful. Getting rid of the tiles (why tiles?) would be at least worth 5 points (out of 100). The list is just too long. If we follow some basic good visualization principles it probably mean a full redesign. Probably too much to ask. 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/10-day.png">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/aha2140/weather/sites/weather-dot-com/10-day.png" width="50%">
</a>

So the takeaway is that the most popular weather website is badly designed, is full of click-baits and the actual presentation of the weather data is pretty bad. Yet it is almost as popular as the NYT website.
