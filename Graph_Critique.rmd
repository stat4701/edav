This Graph shows how people communte to work in the eight major cities in the US.



**Critique**


1. Some colors are hard to differentiate
2. Using the Letters makes it hard to compare two cities together
3. Scale not obvious 
4. Different width because of letters that doesn't mean anything
5. Choice of colors makes it hard to tell what is the dominant method of transportation for each city
